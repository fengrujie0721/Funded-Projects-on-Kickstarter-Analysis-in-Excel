Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. An analyze of a database of 4,000 past projects was done in order to uncover any hidden trends.

1.	Three conclusions
A.	Category Theater has the largest number of successful cases, which is 839. 
B.	Sub-Category Plays has the largest number of successful cases, which is 694.
C.	May is the month that has the most successful cases.
2.	Limitations
There are all together 300,000 cases. The sample here is only 4,000. Only a third can get positive outcome. In this sample, the success rate is 2185/4114=0.53. Therefore, the sample showed higher success rate than the actual one.
3.	Other possible tables/graphs
We can get pivot table that counts how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per country, per goal.
