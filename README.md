1.	Three conclusions
A.	Category Theater has the largest number of successful cases, which is 839. 
B.	Sub-Category Plays has the largest number of successful cases, which is 694.
C.	May is the month that has the most successful cases.
2.	Limitations
There are all together 300,000 cases. The sample here is only 4,000. Only a third can get positive outcome. In this sample, the success rate is 2185/4114=0.53. Therefore, the sample showed higher success rate than the actual one.
3.	Other possible tables/graphs
We can get pivot table that counts how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per country, per goal.
